    <p><strong>Task 1.</strong> Imagine that you are preparing a project with your friend. You have found some interesting material for the presentation and you want to read this text to your friend. You have 1.5 minutes to read the text silently, then be ready to read it out loud. You will not have more than 1.5 minutes to read it.</p>

  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Volunteering has become more popular among young people. It is a great way to help others and to learn new skills. Many students take part in local or international volunteering projects. They may work in hospitals, clean parks, or teach children. Volunteering gives young people a chance to understand different cultures and social problems. It also helps them to become more responsible and confident. Some universities even take volunteering experience into account during admission. Although volunteers don’t get paid, they often say they receive something more important — the feeling of doing good for the world.</p>
